<p>A woman waiting in a car looking at two men talking in front of an apartment building through the windshield. One man is holding papers and looking at them and asking the other questions. The other is answering and looking eager. The first one hands him the papers and shakes his head &ldquo;no&rdquo; and walks off. The remaining man, looks down trodden, heads toward in the car and gets in.</p>
<p>Woman: How did it go Jim?</p>
<p>Man (Jim): Not so good. </p>
<p>Woman: Didn&rsquo;t they have any apartments open?</p>
<p>Man: No, he said they did.</p>
<p>Woman: So what&rsquo;s the problem? Why didn&rsquo;t you go in and look at them?</p>
<p>Man: Forget about it.</p>
<p>Woman (little bit frustrated and worried.): Jim, what&rsquo;s going on? What did he say?</p>
<p>Jim (Pausing, embarrassed): Ok, he said he recognized me. He said he saw me sleeping at the park last year. I told him I was having trouble then, but I&rsquo;m okay now. Butâ€¦ he said he couldn&rsquo;t rent to someone like me. He said the other tenants might not like it. He didn&rsquo;t want to risk it.</p>
<p>Woman: He can&rsquo;t do that! That&rsquo;s not legal. Let&rsquo;s go talk to him!</p>
<p>Jim: No! Forget it. I just want to go back to my sister&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Woman (Considers for a minute): Okay, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
