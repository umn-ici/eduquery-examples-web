A woman&rsquo;s voice: I work for both Janelle and Minnie. I&rsquo;m amazed by how independent Janelle is. Even though she uses a wheelchair, she is more active than I am! She works part-time, goes to the State Capitol several times each year to protest budget cuts, and plays wheelchair tennis weekly. The only tasks I help her with are housekeeping and cooking.
