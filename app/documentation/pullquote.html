<p>Drugs can change the way the brain functions. Addiction happens because the person wants to feel the same &ldquo;high&rdquo; or pleasure they initially got from the drug. Due to changes in the brain they now need to take more of the drug to get the same feeling. Addiction to drugs can permanently damage the way the brain communicates with other parts of the body.</p>
