<p><strong>Title:</strong> Women and Men<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> Women and men do not experience depression in the same way. Women are 70% more likely than men to have depression in their lifetime. Women should watch for changes during pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. Women are also more likely to seek help than men for depression. They are more likely to attempt suicide but less likely to complete it.<br>
  Some men feel sad or down when depressed. However, some men feel more angry or irritable. Men are diagnosed with depression less often than women. However the impact is often more serious. Men with mental illness are more likely than women to have substance abuse issues (3.6% versus 3%). Men are also 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than women. Men tend to be more reluctant to seek help or recognize the value of help than women.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Transgender, Non-Binary, and LGBTQ<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> Those in the<a href="http://www.collegeofdirectsupport.com/Content/Sertoma/TN736mastgloss.htm#transgender">Transgender</a>, Non-Binary, or LGBTQ population have the same depression risks as others. But, they also experience unique risks that increase their vulnerability. In fact, LGBTQ youth are twice as likely to make a suicide attempt as peers. People in LGBTQ groups experience a deep prejudice in most communities. Their families and others who could protect them might offer little support. Sometimes family can be the source of harassment or even harm the person. This can lead to significant trauma, anxiety, and depression. Many LGBTQ youth are homeless. People of all ages may be estranged from family or leading lives where they feel they must hide essential parts of themselves from others in order to stay safe.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Economic Status<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> People living in poverty are more likely than others to experience depression. A Gallup poll found that nearly 31% of those in poverty say they have been diagnosed with depression as compared to 15.8% of people not in poverty. Poverty causes stress and anxiety. Trauma and loss is a common experience in poorer communities. Also, those in poverty more often have other health issues, like diabetes, heart disease, or asthma. They typically have more barriers to quality health care and treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Culture/Ethnicity/Racial Identity<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> A person&rsquo;s culture and background can affect how they experience and view depression. Some of the things affected by culture include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How the person views depression; whether they see it at all</li>
  <li>How and if the person communicates about symptoms</li>
  <li>Amount of support within community to identify and treat mental illnesses</li>
  <li>What words and body language are used to describe symptoms</li>
  <li>How a person understands the symptoms</li>
  <li>Whether or not a person is comfortable seeing a professional</li>
  <li>What the preferences for treatment are</li>
  <li>What type and quality of care is provided by treatment professionals</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas about life and mental health can be different between groups. How a person views individuality and purpose can vary. How time passes can be seen very differently. The definitions of health and wellness can also differ. Even with a translator, a person may not have the words and views that allow them to understand Western approaches to mental health.</p>
