  <strong>Title:</strong> Chemicals<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> The cells in our brains communicate by sending messages to one another. They need the right chemicals to do this. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters. The brains of people living with mental illness often have too much or too little of these important chemicals. This can lead to changes in how the person feels. It can also disrupt the ability to think. Serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are three important chemicals that affect how the brain functions.</p>
<p><strong>Tab #2</strong><br>
  <strong>Title:</strong> Brain Structures<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> Different parts of our brains have different functions. Some parts of the brain might be an unusual size in a person living with mental illness. They might have more or less neurons or cells than other areas. In both depression and schizophrenia people generally have a smaller than usual hippocampus. Researchers have found that a person living with bipolar disorder has more cells that release dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the thalamus.</p>
<p><strong>Tab #3</strong><br>
  <strong>Title:</strong> Faulty Functioning<br>
  <strong>Text:</strong> Normal brain functions may have trouble switching on or off with certain mental illnesses. Some research indicates that the areas of the brain that alert us to problems seem to get stuck in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position for a person living with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. He or she receives signals from the brain that things are not right. This can happen even when the person has checked or rechecked the situation several times.</p>
