		<p>1908 - Eugen Bleuler first used the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; for patients with schizophrenia who appeared to be self-absorbed and that isolated themselves from others. The term autism originates from the Greek word &ldquo;auto&rdquo; meaning self. However, it was later learned that autism and schizophrenia are two completely different disorders.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1943 - Leo Kanner, an American child psychiatrist, conducted research with a group of children. His work helped identify common features of autism. These included social problems, rigidity, strong memory skills, echolalia, sensory issues, and a lack of imaginative play. He also used the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; to refer to the solitary, withdrawn behaviors of these children.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1944 - Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, published research about children with similar traits to Kanner. His work was destroyed in World War II. Years later, people rediscovered his research and Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome became an identified disability.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1960s - Bruno Bettelheim, an Austrian psychologist, wrote a book on children with autism called &ldquo;The Empty Fortress.&rdquo; He claimed their disorder was due to the cold, unfeeling nature of their parents which popularized the term &ldquo;refrigerator mothers.&rdquo; At the time this theory was widely accepted and many children and families suffered because of it. We now know that poor parenting skills and lack of parental attachment are NOT the causes of autism.  Bettelheim&rsquo;s ideas of autism are no longer accepted.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1965 - Bernard Rimland, a psychologist and parent of a child with autism, first introduces the idea that autism is a neurological disorder.  At this point he is able to refute the idea that it is caused by bad parenting.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1970s - First special education classes for children with autism are taught.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1980 - American Psychiatric Association adds autism to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		1990s - Significant increase in autism diagnosis. Reasons offered for increase include better awareness of the symptoms and diagnosis. They also include more public awareness, regional variations in diagnostic criteria, and environmental influences.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		2000 - Significant attention to autism.  This lead to an increase in autism organizations, more  public awareness, and increased research funding.[image: none]<br/>
		<br/>
		2006 - President George Bush signs the &ldquo;Combating Autism Act of 2006&rdquo; with a focus on scientific research on the causes of autism as well as effective treatments.[image: none]<br/>
