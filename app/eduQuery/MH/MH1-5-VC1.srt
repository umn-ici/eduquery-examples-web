00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:02,386
How do we know Jerry's cycling into a manic phase?

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:04,286
He won't sleep or sit still.

3
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:06,556
And this will happen for several days in a row.

4
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:09,736
He paces or roams from room to room all day and night.

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:13,176
This continues until we get his medications back in order.
