			Slide #2:
			<br/>
			Script (character description, if any): Lola has been working with me for over 2 years. She has 4 of her children living with her and is often preoccupied with their issues when she comes to work. She does the best she can when she&#39;s here, but she&#39;s always complaining about how much work she has to do at home with her kids. She talks about how hard it is to &#39;run&#39; two households since she also works for me. A couple of times I&#39;ve even heard her mutter that I should consider myself lucky to have her helping me, because not everyone can get help at home like I do.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Interaction: Multiple Choise - One Question at a time<br/>
			<br/>
			<em>Note: Bolded words may be customized to provide further explanation or context to the learner.</em></br>
			<br/>
			Decide if what is described in the audio clip shows a kind of abusive behavior.<br/>
			<br/>
			Yes [correct] feedback - <strong>You are correct. This constant complaining of the home care provider, and the fact that the person she works for can hear these complaints, could be considered abuse.</strong><br/>
			No feedback - <strong>Sorry, try another answer.</strong><br/>
			<br/>
			Slide #3:<br/>
			<br/>
			Script (character description, if any): I&#39;ve had a couple different home care providers in the last few years. I&#39;m becoming less mobile so I need someone who is strong and can lift and transfer me correctly.This last care provider is a middle-aged man from Nigeria. He&#39;s really strong and good at transferring and lifting me, but sometimes we have a hard time talking to each other.He has a really strong accent and he&#39;s still learning English. Sometimes I get confused and feel like we&#39;re talking in different languages, even though he&#39;s speaking English.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Interaction: Multiple Choise - One Question at a time<br/>
			<br/>
			<em>Note: Bolded words may be customized to provide further explanation or context to the learner.</em></br>
			<br/>
			Decide if what is described in the audio clip shows a kind of abusive behavior.<br/>
			<br/>
			Yes feedback <strong>Sorry, try another answer.</strong><br/>
			<br/>
			No [correct] feedback - <strong>Right, this is not abuse. They&rsquo;re having a hard time communicating with each other because the home care provider is still learning English. He&rsquo;s not trying to play mind games or cause mental anguish.</strong><br/>
			<br/>
			Slide #4:<br/>
			<br/>
			Script (character description, if any):Tanya is a great help to me: she cooks, cleans, and helps me with my personal care. But sometimes I would like to get out of the house and visit my friends. Sometimes I just want to go down to the park and get some fresh air. Other times I&#39;ve told Tanya that I&#39;d like to go with her when she goes grocery shopping, even though I give her a list. But most of the time Tanya doesn&#39;t take me with her shopping, or she&#39;ll suggest staying at home and watching TV instead of going outside. I think she might feel like it&#39;s too much trouble to leave the house with me. I&#39;m constantly telling her that I would like to get out, but it just never happens.<br/>
