          <p>Angie feels like everyone she meets is a new friend. She wants her circle to be wide. She does not need a lot of intimacy or frequency for those relationships to be important to her. It&rsquo;s most important to her to be liked and to be part of whatever is going on at the time. Angie attends events and goes out with groups of friends on a regular basis. She rarely has a personal visit with just her and a friend.</p>
          <h3>Update on Angie</h3>
          <p>As Angie gets older, friends have moved away or stopped getting out as much. Some have passed away. She retired last year and only keeps up with a handful of co-workers. She used to have three or four visits with groups of friends a week. Now, she goes out less than once a week. She frequently says she is bored and wishes she had something to do. Staff help her look through her contact book and decide who to call. This was a strategy that used to work for Angie. But now, it doesn’t often lead to Angie getting together with friends.</p>
