<p>1908 - Eugen Bleuler first used the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; for patients with schizophrenia who appeared to be self-absorbed and that isolated themselves from others. The term autism originates from the Greek word &ldquo;auto&rdquo; meaning self. However, it was later learned that autism and schizophrenia are two completely different disorders.[image: none]</p>
<p>1943 - Leo Kanner, an American child psychiatrist, conducted research with a group of children. His work helped identify common features of autism. These included social problems, rigidity, strong memory skills, echolalia, sensory issues, and a lack of imaginative play. He also used the term &ldquo;autism&rdquo; to refer to the solitary, withdrawn behaviors of these children.[image: none]</p>
<p>1944 - Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, published research about children with similar traits to Kanner. His work was destroyed in World War II. Years later, people rediscovered his research and Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome became an identified disability.[image: none]</p>
<p>1960s - Bruno Bettelheim, an Austrian psychologist, wrote a book on children with autism called &ldquo;The Empty Fortress.&rdquo; He claimed their disorder was due to the cold, unfeeling nature of their parents which popularized the term &ldquo;refrigerator mothers.&rdquo; At the time this theory was widely accepted and many children and families suffered because of it. We now know that poor parenting skills and lack of parental attachment are NOT the causes of autism. Bettelheim&rsquo;s ideas of autism are no longer accepted.[image: none]</p>
