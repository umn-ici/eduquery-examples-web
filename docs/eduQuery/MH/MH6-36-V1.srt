1
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:21,366
Woman: How did it go Jim?

2
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:22,596
Jim: Not so good.

3
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,026
Woman: Well what happened?

4
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,656
Didn't they have any apartments available?

5
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:28,576
Man: No, they had some.

6
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,206
Woman: So what's the problem?

7
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:32,496
Why didn't you go in and look at them?

8
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:34,626
Man: Forget about it.

9
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:36,926
Woman: Jim, what's wrong?

10
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,776
What did he say?

11
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:41,536
Jim: Ok, he said he recognized me.

12
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:45,336
He said he saw me sleeping
at the park last year.

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:50,306
I told him that was a year ago I was
having trouble then, but I'm fine now.

14
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,456
He said he couldn't risk it.

15
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,216
He said that the other tenants wouldn't like it.

16
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,796
Woman: He can't do that!

17
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:01,506
That's not legal.

18
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:02,016
Let's go talk to him!

19
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,786
Jim: No! Forget it.

20
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:06,276
I just want to go back to my sister's.

21
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:14,376
Woman: Okay, let's go.
