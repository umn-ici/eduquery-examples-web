			    <dd>
			    	<p> Throughout this course, we grapple with very complex issues. Among them is the challenge of determining the best way to identify those referred to here as &ldquo;individuals with mental health conditions.&rdquo; Alternative suggestions are as varied as the individuals we serve and include, among other terms:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>individuals with psychiatric disabilities, </li>
						<li>consumers of services,</li>
						<li>those with the lived experience of mental illnesses,</li>
						<li>peers; </li>
						<li>ex-patients/consumer/survivors, and </li>
						<li>individuals living with mental illness. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>All of these terms reflect different philosophical perspectives on mental health conditions and mental health treatment and supports. Because there is no widespread agreement on the &lsquo;right&rsquo; terms to be used, throughout this course we use a few different terms, while recognizing the variety of impassioned objections and reasoned alternatives to each. That said, the terms we use all seek to communicate to you that the individuals we refer to are first and foremost people, and that most have found their way into public mental health systems because their mental health conditions have caused significant interference in their lives. All our language choices are meant to remind practitioners that respect for each person&rsquo;s basic humanity, their holistic needs, and compassion to the circumstances of their lives are essential to supporting recovery and a return of wellbeing.</p>

					<p> Additionally, we use the term Community Mental Health Practitioner (CMHP) throughout this course and in all of the CRCI courses to denote the variety of staff and staff positions represented in the mental health field.</p>
