		<p>Scenario:<br/>
			Casey&rsquo;s update on his social media webpage:<br/>
			The guy I work for is so great! We actually have a lot in common and I like working for him. His name is Mark Smith and he lives in Berkeley, California. He uses a wheelchair and can&rsquo;t move his arms much, so I help him at home in the morning. But it&rsquo;s cool because he&rsquo;s pretty independent and stays by himself at night. He uses his voice on the computer to design websites for other people. He has so many computers in his house, it&rsquo;s unreal! I love talking to him about my passion for computers, graphic design, video games and art.
