1
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:05,096
Mary: The soup's almost ready.

2
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:06,186
Doesn't it smell good?

3
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:07,526
Victor: It sure does.

4
00:00:07,906 --> 00:00:09,496
Did you put the salt in already?

5
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:11,186
I hope it's not too salty.

6
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:11,946
Mary: Here.

7
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:12,866
How about you have a taste.

8
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,016
Mary: Watch out!

9
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:18,196
It's kind of hot.

10
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:21,086
Victor: Oh no!

11
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:24,096
You shouldn't put the spoon back
in there; my germs are all over it.

12
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:25,786
Mary: I do it all the time at home.

13
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:26,966
It's not a big deal.

14
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:29,506
Victor: It's a big deal to me.

15
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,636
From now on, if you can remember,
put the used spoons in the sink

16
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,616
and to always cook with clean utensils.

17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:36,746
Mary: Okay Victor.

18
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,116
I guess I need to remember that
when I'm here I'm working for you

19
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:42,506
and not at home working with my family.
