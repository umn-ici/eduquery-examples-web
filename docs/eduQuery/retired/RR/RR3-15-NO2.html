						Slide #2:
						<br/>
						Script (character description, if any): Lola has been working with me for over 2 years. She has 4 of her children living with her and is often preoccupied with their issues when she comes to work. She does the best she can when she&#39;s here, but she&#39;s always complaining about how much work she has to do at home with her kids. She talks about how hard it is to &#39;run&#39; two households since she also works for me. A couple of times I&#39;ve even heard her mutter that I should consider myself lucky to have her helping me, because not everyone can get help at home like I do.
						<br/>
						Interaction: Multiple Choise - One Question at a time<br/>
						<br/>
						Decide if what is described in the audio clip shows a kind of abusive behavior.<br/>
						Yes [correct] feedback - You are correct. This constant complaining of the home care provider, and the fact that the person she works for can hear these complaints, could be considered abuse.<br/>
						No feedback - Sorry, try another answer.<br/>
						<br/>
						Slide #3:<br/>
						<br/>
						Script (character description, if any): I&#39;ve had a couple different home care providers in the last few years. I&#39;m becoming less mobile so I need someone who is strong and can lift and transfer me correctly.This last care provider is a middle-aged man from Nigeria. He&#39;s really strong and good at transferring and lifting me, but sometimes we have a hard time talking to each other.He has a really strong accent and he&#39;s still learning English. Sometimes I get confused and feel like we&#39;re talking in different languages, even though he&#39;s speaking English.
						<br/>
						Interaction: Multiple Choise - One Question at a time<br/>
						<br/>
						Decide if what is described in the audio clip shows a kind of abusive behavior.<br/>
						Yes feedback Sorry, try another answer.<br/>
						No [correct] feedback - Right, this is not abuse. They&rsquo;re having a hard time communicating with each other because the home care provider is still learning English. He&rsquo;s not trying to play mind games or cause mental anguish.<br/>
						<br/>
						Slide #4:<br/>
						<br/>
						Script (character description, if any):Tanya is a great help to me: she cooks, cleans, and helps me with my personal care. But sometimes I would like to get out of the house and visit my friends. Sometimes I just want to go down to the park and get some fresh air. Other times I&#39;ve told Tanya that I&#39;d like to go with her when she goes grocery shopping, even though I give her a list. But most of the time Tanya doesn&#39;t take me with her shopping, or she&#39;ll suggest staying at home and watching TV instead of going outside. I think she might feel like it&#39;s too much trouble to leave the house with me. I&#39;m constantly telling her that I would like to get out, but it just never happens.<br/>
						<br/>
						Interaction: Multiple Choise - One Question at a time<br/>
						<br/>
						Decide if what is described in the audio clip shows a kind of abusive behavior.<br/>
						Yes [correct] feedback - You are correct. Not letting someone do what he wants to do, such as seeing his friends or going outside, can be considered abuse. Especially if the person has clearly communicated that with his care provider.<br/>
						No feedback - Sorry, try another answer.<br/>
