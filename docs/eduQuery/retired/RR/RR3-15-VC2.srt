1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,976
I've had a couple different home care providers in the last few years.

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,216
I'm becoming less mobile so I need someone who is strong

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,856
and can lift and transfer me correctly.

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:11,256
This last care provider is a middle-aged man from Nigeria.

5
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,346
He's really strong and good at transferring and lifting me,

6
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:17,036
but sometimes we have a hard time talking to each other.

7
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,286
He has a really strong accent and he's still learning English.

8
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:23,956
Sometimes I get confused and feel like we're talking in different languages,

9
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,756
even though he's speaking English.
