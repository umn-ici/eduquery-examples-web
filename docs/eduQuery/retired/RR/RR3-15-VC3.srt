Tanya is a great help to me: she cooks, cleans, and helps me with my personal care.

2
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:08,806
But sometimes I would like to get out of the house and visit my friends.

3
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,626
Sometimes I just want to go down to the park and get some fresh air.

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,846
Other times I've told Tanya that I'd like to go with her

5
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:19,396
when she goes grocery shopping, even though I give her a list.

6
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:24,556
But most of the time Tanya doesn't take me with her shopping, or she'll suggest staying at home

7
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,636
and watching TV instead of going outside.

8
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:30,026
I think she might feel like it's too much trouble to leave the house with me.

9
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:34,426
I'm constantly telling her that I would like to get out, but it just never happens.
